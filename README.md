# Nexthink Remote Action – Get Microsoft Edge Plugins Name (macOS)

## Purpose

This script complements the Nexthink Remote Action **"Get Microsoft Edge Plugins Name"**, which is only available for **Windows** by default.

It provides a **macOS-compatible version** to collect:

- The **name** of each installed Microsoft Edge extension
- The **version**
- Whether it is **enabled** or **disabled**

---

## Notes

- This is a direct adaptation of Nexthink’s official `get-chrome-plugins.sh` script.
- It has been updated to work with **Microsoft Edge on macOS**.
- Output format and naming conventions are consistent with Nexthink’s expected fields.
